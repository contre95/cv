    I'm an engineering student at UNSAM, currently living in Argentina. I'm also a Site Reliability Engineer at Edrans, specializing in infrastructure automation, and automation development. I love to take on new challenges that push me to keep learning. Discussing all possibles workarounds and best practices to solve a problem is what I enjoy the most. Moreover, I believe a great part of who we are is whom we hang with, that's why I'm always looking forward to working with knowledgeable people, to grow as both a professional and a human being.
