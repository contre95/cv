    I'm an engineering student at UNSAM and a Site Reliability Engineer at Edrans, specializing in infrastructure automation, and automation development.
    I love to take on new challenges that push me to keep learning.
    Discussing all possibles workarounds and best practices to solve a problem is what I enjoy the most.
    Moreover, I believe a great part of who we are is whom we hang with, that's why I'm always looking forward to working with knowledgeable people, to grow as both a professional and a human being.
